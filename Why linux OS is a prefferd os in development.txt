Linux is more prefered OS by developers because it has slightly faster compilers and interpreters, compared to Windows or Mac. Linux also has less OS complexity which also makes it attractive for coders to work with the internal environment of the OS. This is why applications run smoother and are better optimised. In addition, it offers support for most of the programming languages available today. Generally, programming languages are catered to one OS (Visual Basic in Windows is the best example) but if a language does not come with this restriction, it mostly works on Linux. All this said programming becomes less burdensome with Linux.
